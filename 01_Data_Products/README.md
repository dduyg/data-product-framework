# Data Products Overview
This folder contains all documentation and artifacts related to individual data products developed and maintained by our team.

## Structure
- Each data product has its own subfolder:
  ```
  01_Data_Products/
    └── <product-name>/
        ├── spec.md             # Product purpose, users, and scope
        ├── api-contracts.md    # API endpoint definitions and schemas
        ├── architecture.md    # System structure and components
        └── changelog.md       # Release notes and update history
  ```

## How to Use
- **Adding a new product:**  
  Create a new folder with the product name and include the key docs.

- **Updating docs:**  
  Keep specs, API contracts, architecture, and changelog up to date with any changes.

- **Finding info:**  
  Start with `spec.md` for product overview, then explore API contracts or architecture as needed.
