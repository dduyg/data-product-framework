## 🔍 Key Metrics to Track

| Metric                      | Description                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Compute Costs               | Expenses related to processing power (e.g., cloud compute, clusters) |
| Storage Costs               | Costs for data storage (e.g., S3, databases) |
| Network Costs               | Expenses from data transfer and egress |
| Licensing Fees             | Costs of third-party software or services |
| Cost per Data Product      | Allocation of costs by product or team |

## 🛠️ Tools & Integrations

- Cloud provider cost dashboards (AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing, Azure Cost Management)
- Third-party cost management tools (Cloudability, CloudHealth)
- Custom dashboards integrating billing APIs and metrics
- Tagging resources by team, project, or environment for allocation

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- Implement tagging and labeling for granular cost tracking
- Set budgets and alerts for unexpected cost spikes
- Regularly review and analyze cost reports
- Optimize resource usage (e.g., rightsizing, reserved instances)
- Automate cleanup of unused resources

---

## 📈 Cost Optimization Strategies

- Use data partitioning and lifecycle policies to reduce storage costs
- Schedule workloads during off-peak hours if cheaper
- Leverage serverless or spot instances when applicable
- Review and optimize data retention policies
