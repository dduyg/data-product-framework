# Data Mesh

A decentralized approach to data architecture promoting domain ownership and scalability.

## 🔍 What is Data Mesh?

Data mesh is a paradigm shift in data architecture where data ownership is distributed to domain teams rather than centralized data teams. It treats data as a product and emphasizes interoperability, self-service, and governance.

## 🤔 Why Data Mesh?

- **Scalability:** Enables large organizations to scale data by decentralizing responsibility.
- **Domain Ownership:** Teams closest to the data own and manage it, improving quality and context.
- **Self-Service:** Empowers teams with tools and infrastructure to build and serve their own data products.
- **Federated Governance:** Balances autonomy with company-wide standards and policies.

## ⚙️ Principles of Data Mesh

1. **Domain-Oriented Data Ownership:** Data is managed by cross-functional domain teams.
2. **Data as a Product:** Treat data as a product with clear SLAs, documentation, and discoverability.
3. **Self-Serve Data Infrastructure:** Provide platforms and tools to enable teams to manage data autonomously.
4. **Federated Computational Governance:** Implement policies to ensure interoperability, security, and compliance.
