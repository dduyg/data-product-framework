# Data Lineage

Understanding the flow of data from source to destination and transformations applied.

## 🔍 What is Data Lineage?

Data lineage describes the lifecycle of data: where it originates, how it moves through systems, and what transformations are applied. It provides a map of data flow across pipelines, databases, and applications.

## 🤔 Why Data Lineage Matters

- **Traceability:** Helps track the origin of data points for debugging and auditing.
- **Impact Analysis:** Understand downstream effects of changes in upstream data or processes.
- **Compliance:** Supports regulatory requirements by providing transparent data flow documentation.
- **Data Quality:** Detects anomalies and root causes by tracing data transformations.

## ⚙️ Components of Data Lineage

- **Source Identification:** Where data enters the system.
- **Transformation Steps:** How data is modified or enriched.
- **Data Movement:** Transfer mechanisms between systems or storage layers.
- **Consumption Points:** Final destinations or reports using the data.

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques

- Automated lineage extraction via ETL tools (e.g., Apache Atlas, Amundsen).
- Metadata tracking and cataloging.
- Visualization dashboards for data flow.
